# Ray-Tracer
Following along with the ray tracer tutorial Ray Tracing in one Weekend

Here is the website: https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html

I used this [website](https://www.cs.rhodes.edu/welshc/COMP141_F16/ppmReader.html) to view the ppm files, or use vscode extension that someone made specifically for this tutorial.
